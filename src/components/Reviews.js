          <p>Teaching technology, that is continually changing and upgrading everyday, is a big challenge especially to the blooming tinkerers who are full of enthusiasm to innovate. Undoubtedly after 3 successful years of being the ATL in Charge and the 4th year running, it has been an amazing experience and journey from scratch to winning the National Award and other accolades and continuing everyday with emerging challenges.</p>

          <p>For the past few months, my co-innovator and I created Disrobo, even though this was a partially independent project, Rabvik Innovations have a huge role to play in it, The way Rabvik Innovations has shaped the infrastructural system in our schoolâ€™s ATL Lab, was a pivotal factor in building our project. Thus, our school Sri Sri Academy and Rabvik Innovations, have an immense input in building this project and raising it to such an immense platform.</p>
